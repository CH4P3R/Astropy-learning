# Astropy-learning
My repository for learning the Astropy library in Python.

This project is a Python-based scientific project using Astropy and related libreries. The project is designed to be run in a fully isolated Conda environment to ensure reproducibility.

Requirements:
- Python 3.13
- Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS

Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/CH4P3R/Astropy-learning.git <br/>
   cd Astropy-learning

2. Create and activate the Conda environment: <br/>
   conda env create -f environment.yml <br/>
   conda activate astropy-env

Notes:

The Conda environment is portable and ensures all dependencies are installed automatically. Always activate the Conda environment before running scripts to use the correct Python version and packages.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, make sure to select the Python interpreter from the Conda environment you created, instead of your global Python installation.
